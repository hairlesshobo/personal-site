Here I am - once again - wanting to build a personal website that I don't hate to use. I've tried hand-created HTML, dokuwiki, and wordpress - hated them all. Trying [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) now since its a static site generate that lets you write in markdown. I already write all of my own personal notes in [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) using markdown and I document my code using markdown, so maybe I will actually stick with this since the site is built in markdown and I don't have to put any thought into the actual site design itself.

Stay posted (hopefully) for more content soon...
