My name is Steve, also known online as hairlesshobo, and on amateur radio my call sign is KN4GOI. I am a mid 30s married father of four kids, ages 5 through 12, who loves to tinker and I honestly have more hobbies than I even know what to do with. Without a doubt my biggest hobby has always been computers, and anything to do with computers. I started building computers at 7, coding Perl at 10, and I built my first Linux server when I was 11 (I even remember the hardware I used to build it, maybe I will write a post about it one day) and have had at least one personal server running 24/7 since that very first system. 

Profesionally I am an infrastructure/DevOps engineer. In addition to that, I lead the production team and oversee all aspects of live and post production media at a local church. Needless to say, I don’t have a ton of free time, so don’t expect to see updates here very often.

I am also an open source programmer, ham radio operator, 3d printer, photographer, photomicrographer, astrophotographer, hardware engineer, musician, recording engineer, and just about anything else that I can get my hands on. Either personally or professionally I have worked with the following technologies and languages to varying degrees over the years (some have most certainly been forgotten and left out): AWS, Azure, Terraform, Linux, MacOS, BSD, Windows, Android, C, C++, C#, Java, XHTML, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python, PostgresQL, MSSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, Bash, PowerShell, and miscellaneous others. My platform of choice these days for software development is .NET Core and Python, I even have a few projects that use both.
